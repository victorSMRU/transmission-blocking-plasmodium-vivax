# transmission-blocking-plasmodium-vivax

This repository provides data and code for the analysis of a laboratory study carried out to assess the transmission-blocking activity of antimalarial drugs (artesunate, chloroquine and methylene blue) against _Plasmodium vivax_ gametoyctes.

This analysis was carried out by Victor Chaumeau* under the supervision of James A. Waston, who developed the analysis framework and wrote the Stan code for the Bayesian multi-level model used in this study, based on the original work of Medeley _et al._

Chloroquine exhibited little transmission-blocking activity on _P. vivax_ gametocytes, despite the high concentrations used (Figure 1). Of all dissected mosquitos in the chloroquine spiked samples, 2974/4036 (74%) carried oocysts in the treated replicates compared with 3299/4026 (82%) in the controls (relative risk, RR: 0.85 [95% confidence interval, CI: 0.82 to 0.88], p<0.0001) and 701/1177 (60%) carried sporozoites in the treated replicates compared with 785/1228 (64%) in the controls (RR: 0.89 [95%CI: 0.81 to 0.97], p=0.005). In contrast, artesunate and methylene blue almost completely interrupted gametocyte transmission. For artesunate, only 207/1798 (12%) of the mosquitos carried oocysts in the treated replicates compared with 1591/1797 (89%) in the controls (RR: 0.057 [95%CI: 0.044 to 0.075], p<0.0001) and 1/360 (0.3%) dissected mosquitos carried sporozoites in the treated replicates versus 152/360 (42%) in the controls (RR: 0.005 [95%CI: 0.001 to 0.035], p<0.0001); for methylene blue, only 76/1599 (5%) carried oocysts in the treated replicates versus 1470/1592 (92%) in the controls (RR: 0.039 [95%CI: 0.028 to 0.054], p<0.0001) and only 5/320 (1.6%) carried sporozoites in the treated replicates versus 267/320 (83%) in the controls (RR: 0.01 [95%CI: 0.003 to 0.027], p<0.0001).

__Figure 1. Effects of chloroquine, methylene blue and artesunate on the development of _P. vivax_ in _An. dirus_.__ (A-C) Median oocyst count; (D-F) oocyst index; (G-I) median sporozoite count; (J-L) sporozoite index. Values in the control and treated replicates were collated by assay run.

We estimated the drug effects under a Bayesian multi-level model (mixed effects) whereby the count data were modelled as negative binomial with the dispersion parameter as a parametric function of the mean count. The model parameterized the drug effect as a reduction in the mean number of parasites per mosquito, accounting for variability across blood samples and mosquito batches. Under this model, gametocyte exposure to chloroquine decreased the mean oocyst count by only 1.40 fold (95% credible interval, CrI: 1.20 to 1.65; a mean of 100 oocysts per mosquito in the controls versus 69 in the treated replicates), and it decreased the mean sporozoite count by 1.34 fold (95%CrI: 1.12 to 1.66; 14,414 sporozoites per mosquito in the controls versus 11,132 in the treated replicates). In contrast, artesunate reduced the mean oocyst count by 469 fold (95%CrI: 345 to 650;  60 oocysts per mosquito in the controls versus 0.22 in the treated replicates), and methylene blue reduced the oocyst count 1438 fold (95%CrI: 970 to 2064; 107 oocysts per mosquito in the controls versus 0.08 in the treated replicates). For the sporozoite counts the estimates were a 148-fold reduction for artesunate (95%CrI: 61 to 470; 1303 sporozoites per mosquito in the controls versus 0.1 in the treated replicates), and a 536 fold for methylene blue (95%CrI: 246 to 1311; 13,914 sporozoites per mosquito in the controls versus 1.8 in the treated replicates). The model fitted the data well as shown by the inferred relationship between the mean parasite count and proportion of Plasmodium-infected specimens in mosquito samples (Figure 2).
